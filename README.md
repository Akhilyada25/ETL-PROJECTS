# ETL-PROJECTS
Retail Sales Data Pipeline with Google BigQuery & Apache Airflow
📌 Overview
This project builds an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process retail sales data and store it in Google BigQuery for analytics. The pipeline extracts data from an AWS S3 bucket, transforms it using PySpark, and loads it into a partitioned and clustered data warehouse in BigQuery. Apache Airflow orchestrates the entire process.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Source: CSV files from AWS S3 (or PostgreSQL)
ETL Tool: Apache Airflow
Processing Framework: PySpark
Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery
Storage: Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
Version Control: Git
Orchestration: Apache Airflow
Monitoring: Slack/Email Alerts
⚙️ ETL Pipeline Workflow
1️⃣ Extract:

Fetch raw sales data (CSV format) from AWS S3.
Load the raw data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
2️⃣ Transform:

Read data using PySpark.
Handle missing values, standardize formats, and clean the data.
Aggregate sales data by region, product category, and time period.
3️⃣ Load:

Store transformed data into Google BigQuery.
Optimize with partitioning and clustering.
4️⃣ Orchestration:

Apache Airflow DAGs automate and schedule ETL workflows.
Implement failure handling & retries with Airflow.
Send alerts via Slack or Email in case of failures.
